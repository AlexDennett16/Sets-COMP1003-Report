# Sets-COMP1003-Report
University Module created to demonstrate understanding of high level language operations on Lists, Arrays etc  

We define many of our own functions to determine object size, total capacity, and then build on these to add and remove elements  

We can then show evidence of working functions, with printed outputs to a console
